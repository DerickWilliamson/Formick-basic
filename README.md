# Formick-basic

This is an extremely basic Formick assingment for a class that required it to be uploaded to Github.

If for some reason you want to give it a go download, NPM i followed by NPM start while in the root folder.

It will simply show an email, and a password and if any values are provided it gives pop up saying success otherwise it says required.
